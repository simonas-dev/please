    Based on the following git diff, create a scope of impact analysis for QA testing. Avoid being too specific on things that need to be regression tested. Assumptions might be wrong. Assume nothing. Do not give directions, but evaluate the scope affected.

    Try to be less technical when creating a report. Do not assume that a person is quite familar with the codebase and understands code. 

    Don't use tables.

    Don't use text formatting like bolding, italics, or anything similar to that. Plain text only.

    List each impacted area and specify potencial regression impact. Only that a list of impact. No summary.

    Be brief and to a point. Keep the text readable in under a minute. Less the better, but mention all high risk areas. Ensuring there are no regressions is the priority

    Print a disclaimer: 'The scope of impact was generated with LLM gpt-oss-20b by reading code changes.'.

    Evalaute if the piece of code change has an impact for production end user.

    Create such structure for the message, where all text would be replaced with the evalaution of the scope of impact.

    ```
    Replace with impacted scope title:
    - specific notes about impact.
    - specific notes about impact.
    - specific notes about impact.
    Replace with impacted scope title:
    - specific notes about impact.
    - specific notes about impact.
    - specific notes about impact.
    ```
